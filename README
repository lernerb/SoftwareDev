##### Compiling
No additional compiling is required in order to run the sofware (python)

##### Installing
Add ./ to your path in order to run `./spims`.

##### Running
The software can be invoked using the format specified in the assignment:

    ./spims -p <file1> -s <file2>

where:
 * both `<file1>` and `<file2>` are JPEG, PNG, or GIF (No Animation)
 * `<file1>` is the name of the "pattern image"
 * `<file2>` is the name of the "source image"

##### Testing -> TODO: REMOVE TESTER FROM SUBMISSION
Change directories into the Scripts folder and run the following

    ./tester assignment4

The tester uses the first argument to determine what set of tests to run.
`assignment4` is the set of tests specified in the assignment given by Professor Clinger.

##### Additional notes
It was discussed with Prof. Clinger on Feb 12 that additional line returns 
at the end of the execution of the program do not matter.

##### Software Credits
