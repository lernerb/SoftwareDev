##### Installing
Add ./ to your path in order to run `./spims`.

##### Running
The software can be invoked using the format specified in the assignment. For convenience it has been duplicated here:

    ./spims -m <file1> -s <file2>

where:
 * `<file1>` is the name of an existing file in JPEG, PNG, or GIF format without animation (the "pattern image")
 * `<file2>` is the name of an existing file in JPEG, PNG, or GIF format without animation (the "source image")
